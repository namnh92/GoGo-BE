# GoGo `/v1` contract changelog

Consumers vendor `openapi/gogo.v1.yaml` and generate their client from it, so a
changed guarantee has to be readable without diffing 700 KB of YAML. One entry
per contract version that changes a published guarantee; a version that only
adds optional fields or new paths does not need one.

Version numbers follow `git.md` SemVer: MAJOR when a published guarantee is
withdrawn, MINOR for backward-compatible additions, PATCH for fixes.

## 2.0.0-alpha.1 — `GET /v1/rooms/{id}/events` carries two frame shapes

**Breaking.** The SSE response of `GET /v1/rooms/{id}/events` is a `oneOf`: a
domain-event envelope, or `RoomEventResync { roomId, reason, checkpoint }`. The
previous schema described every frame as the domain-event envelope, so a client
generated from `1.0.0-alpha.*` may treat the envelope's fields as guaranteed —
they are absent on a `resync` frame.

- **What a consumer must do:** read the SSE `event:` name before parsing
  `data`. `event: resync` carries `RoomEventResync`, never a domain event. On a
  resync the client refetches authoritative room state and, **only after that
  refetch succeeds**, resumes from `checkpoint.cursor` — the opaque cursor, not
  the `checkpoint` object, and never a cursor built from `generation` and `seq`,
  which are informational (`RoomEventCheckpoint`). An unknown `reason` is
  treated exactly like a known one: refetch.
- **Why it is a MAJOR and not a schema fix:** the `resync` control frame already
  existed on the wire (ADR-0027 made it reliable and gave it the checkpoint); the
  published schema was wrong about it. Withdrawing the envelope guarantee is a
  real break for a generated client even though the server behaviour it describes
  got stricter, not looser.
- **Shipped in:** PR #666 (GoGo-BE#638), contract `1.0.0-alpha.65`. The
  breaking-change gate was red on that head and skipped on the push to
  `develop`, so the change landed without the gate ever passing (GoGo-BE#694).
  This version is where the break is _named_: the decision was to keep the
  `oneOf` (SA ruling on #694, owner decision 2026-10-16), record it here and in
  ADR-0027, and admit the historical oasdiff finding through
  `.github/oasdiff-exceptions.json` — not to reshape the contract around the
  tool.
- **Consumers at the time of writing:** GoGo-MobileApp handles `event: resync`
  before parsing the payload (`2447dc7`) but still vendors `1.0.0-alpha.57`;
  GoGo-CMS and GoGo-WebApp do not read this stream.

Earlier versions (`1.0.0-alpha.1` … `1.0.0-alpha.73`) predate this file. Their
history is in `git log -- openapi/gogo.v1.yaml` and in the ADRs they reference.
